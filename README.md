#### WebApp to manage copiers in service.
With this application we can manage with history of serviced devices(service visits, replacement of consumables etc.).

From customer site it will be possible to order consumables or service directly to device(by serial number or address).

And many many more features will come over time.

------------
At this moment we can add new manufacturers and models and edit them.
This section will be updated with the application growth.

##### This is my first app created with SpringBoot, technologies  that I used to do it:
