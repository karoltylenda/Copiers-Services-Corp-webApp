# Copiers-Services-Corp-webApp

#### WebApp to manage copiers in service.
With this application we can manage with history of serviced devices(service visits, replacement of consumables etc.).

From customer site it will be possible to order consumables or service directly to device(by serial number or address).

And many many more features will come over time.
